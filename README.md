# 🛡️ Writeup: CTF IDN Cyber Security 2025

## 🎯 CTF (Capture The Flag) : 

**Capture The Flag (CTF)** is a competition in the field of cybersecurity designed to test participants' skills in identifying, exploiting, and securing information systems. In this competition, participants aim to find hidden "flags" in a variety of provided challenges. Flags are usually in the form of unique strings, such as 

```
IDN_FLAG{example_flag} or IDN_CTF{example_flag}
```

Which serve as proof that a participant has successfully completed a specific challenge.

One of the common formats in CTF competitions is 🧩 Jeopardy Style. In this format, participants are presented with various categories of challenges such as:

- 🌐 Web Exploitation
- 🔍 Forensics
- 🔐 Cryptography
- 🚨 Incident Response

Each challenge has an equal score and there are no point deductions. Participants are free to choose which challenges to solve first. The cumulative score from successfully solved challenges will determine the participants' ranking on the scoreboard.
